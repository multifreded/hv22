# Day 01 / HV22.01 QR means quick reactions, right?



## Challenge

* Author: Deaths Pirate
* Tags:   `#fun`
* Level:  easy

Santa's brother Father Musk just bought out a new decoration factory. He sacked
all the developers and tried making his own QR code generator but something
seems off with it. Can you try and see what he's done wrong?

## Solution

The file `hackvent2022_01.gif` is an animated GIF. Each frame contains a QR code
that holds one letter of the flag. The frames can be viewed as layers in Gimp.
The QR codes were simply scanned with a QR decoding app one frame at a time.
